# Mix n'Joy

---
This is a project for those who love to try new mixed beverages!

Hi there! I am Steven Perez, I am currently working on a MERN CRUD Application.

I have always wanted to learn about mixing drinks as a hobby and was about to buy a book to learn and that's when I got inspired! 
Instead of buying a book on Mixology, why not make an application that is Fullstack, so I can flex my coding skills and when I am done, I can have my very own personalized application for a hobby that I have always wanted to take on!

If you stumbled upon this application feel free to check it out! I plan on working throughout this project for a while, it has helped me develop my skills further with all the technology being used and connected. 

I am utilizing React, Tailwind, and Vite for the Front End of my application

For the Backend aspect, I am using Node, Express, MongoDB and a few other middleware dependencies. 

The way that you would use this is by either browsing through the api rendered drinks cards, search up a specific drink, get a surprise me drink, or by an interactive way, what's in my bar? 

I hope you all enjoy and use this app for your next mixing attempt!

Leave some feedback and feel free to reach out.
